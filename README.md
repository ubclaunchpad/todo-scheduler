# :calendar: To-Do Scheduler

To-Do Scheduler is an app that allows the user to schedule unscheduled to-do items into their day based on the user's calendar and anticipated duration and urgency of items on their to-do list. 

The Todo Scheduler aims to combat a common inefficiency in time management amongst students and full-time workers; that is being unproductive during short periods of free time throughout the day. This app aims to help users stay on top of their unscheduled, but important, responsibilities, such as personal paperwork, paying bills, and home maintenance (especially important while working from home), by scheduling these tasks into small slots of availability in the user's calendar.


## :computer: Installation

1. The To-Do Scheduler app is built using Flutter. Please follow [this tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to set up your development environment. Android Studio and XCode (for iOS) are two good options for development, as they allow you to easily test your app using an emulator.
2. Once you have your development environment set up, either use your IDE's git GUI or the `git clone` command to clone `https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/todo_scheduler.git`. 
3. a) If you are using Android Studio, you can then [create a new virtual device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) and [run the app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/test-drive?tab=androidstudio#run-the-app). 
   b) If you are using XCode, in the command line, type the following command to open the simulator:
    <pre><code>open -a simulator</code></pre> 
    Then, to run the app: 
    <pre><code>flutter run</code></pre>
